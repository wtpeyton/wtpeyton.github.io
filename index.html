                <h2>About me</h2><p>
                    As a student, I am striving to find success through exploring computer science opportunities 
                    both professionally and academically. I aim to become involved in undergraduate artificial intelligence research, 
                    tech internships, and conservation service work, also, I plan to eventually work towards graduate school. </p>

                        This diagram is broken into five seperate sections:
                        Website Requirements, Revenue Generation, Legal Requirements, Tech Requirements, Maintence/Staffing Requirements.
                        Each of these catergories focuses on a requirement to develop this business in order to solve the lack of access to transportation between Charlotte and Columbia.

                        The three sketches depict a layout of a website and app for the company Travel with Me. 
                        Each image shows a feature of the company to ensure student's access to transportation.
                        Most notably, there are four main types of travel, including trains, buses, cars/shuttles, and planes. 
                        Additionally, The app will use a Google Maps API to give a video depiction of the directions. 
                        Finally, There will be suggestions for things to do, places to eat, and places to stay.
